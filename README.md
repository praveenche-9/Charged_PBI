Here we have provided the forcefield parameters for homo polymers of Polybenzimidazolium (CT) and Polybenzimidazolide (AN) as well as their corresponding co-polymer .itp and .PDB files. 
In all of these files, the polymer contains 5 repeat units.  
The total polymeric charge distribution is given as AN: -10, 2AN: -2, 6AN: -6, as well as CT: +10, 2CT: +2, and 6CT:+10.
These files can be used for running Molecular dynamics simulations of various charged and uncharged polymers.
As well as We also provide the PDB files and ITP files for the Ionic liquids for EMIM as common cations, BF4, PF6, NO3, and Tf2N

If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to contact us.

Here we have providing the forcefield parameters fof homo polymers of Polybenzimidazolium (CT) and Polybenzimidazolide (AN) as well as their corresponing co-polymer .itp and .PDB files. 
In All of these files polymer contain 5 repat units.  
The total polymeric charge distribution is given as AN : -10, 2 AN: -2, 6AN : -6 as weel as CT : +10, 2CT : +2 and 6CT :+10.
These files may can be used for the running Molecular dynamics simulations of various charged and uncharged polymers.
If you have any doubts do not hesitate to contact us.
